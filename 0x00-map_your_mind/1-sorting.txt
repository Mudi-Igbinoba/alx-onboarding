This is a program that reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order

Read a, b, c
If(a < b)
    If(b < c) then write a, b, c 
    Else
        If(c < a) then write c, a, b 
        Else write a, c, b 
Else
If(a < c) then write b, a, c 
    Else
        If(c < b) then write c, b, a
        Else write b, c, a
